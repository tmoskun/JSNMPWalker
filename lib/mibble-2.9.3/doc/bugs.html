    <h2>Suggested Improvements</h2>

    <p>This is a list of the suggested improvements as of the release
    of version 2.9.3 (2013-07-26). The
    most up-to-date version of this list is available from the
    <a href="http://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues">project
    issue tracker</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Error recovery for missing imports</strong><br/>
        Mibble fails to load MIB files referencing symbols from
        other MIBs not imported. Mibble should provide a fallback for
        this, reporting a warning and loading the proper symbol.
        <a href="http://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/2">Issue #2</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>SNMP client capabilities</strong><br/>
        The library currently does not provide any API for
        building an SNMP agent or client. With an API for using
        WestHawk SNMP and/or SNMP4J, a more integrated and easier
        solution could be provided. <a href="http://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/3">Issue #3</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Strict SMIv1 and SMIv2 parsing</strong><br/>
        When parsing SMIv1 files, any usage of symbols or constructs
        from SMIv2 should trigger a warning. The opposite goes for SMIv2 files.
        <a href="http://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/4">Issue #4</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Object serialization</strong><br/>
        There is currently no easy way to store the state of a
        loaded Mib, so the same files have to be parsed every time
        which may be time consuming. By adding object serialization or
        similar this might be faster. <a href="http://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues/5">Issue #5</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
