Suggested Improvements
----------------------

  This is a list of the suggested improvements as of the release of 
  version 2.9.3 (2013-07-26). The most up-to-date version of this 
  list is available from the project issue tracker 
  (http://github.com/cederberg/mibble/issues).

    o Error recovery for missing imports
      Mibble fails to load MIB files referencing symbols from other 
      MIBs not imported. Mibble should provide a fallback for this, 
      reporting a warning and loading the proper symbol. [Issue #2]

    o SNMP client capabilities
      The library currently does not provide any API for building an 
      SNMP agent or client. With an API for using WestHawk SNMP 
      and/or SNMP4J, a more integrated and easier solution could be 
      provided. [Issue #3]

    o Strict SMIv1 and SMIv2 parsing
      When parsing SMIv1 files, any usage of symbols or constructs 
      from SMIv2 should trigger a warning. The opposite goes for 
      SMIv2 files. [Issue #4]

    o Object serialization
      There is currently no easy way to store the state of a loaded 
      Mib, so the same files have to be parsed every time which may 
      be time consuming. By adding object serialization or similar 
      this might be faster. [Issue #5]
