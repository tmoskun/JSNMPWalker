MIBBLE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================

Requirements
------------

  The following requirements must be met in order to use Mibble:

    o Java runtime compatible with JDK 1.4.


Installation
------------

  This software does not require any special installation. The only 
  files needed are the jar-files in the lib subdirectory.


Running
-------

  Mibble is a library, but provides a simple MIB file browser 
  application that can be used for testing purposes. It can be run by 
  double-clicking the MibbleBrowser.jar file that is found in the 
  base directory.

  There are also a few other test tools that can be run from the 
  command-line or via the following scripts:

  bin/MibbleBrowser.sh or bin/MibbleBrowser.bat

  bin/MibblePrinter.sh or bin/MibblePrinter.bat

  bin/MibbleValidator.sh or bin/MibbleValidator.bat

  The above scripts should find and set the Java CLASSPATH to the 
  jar-files in the lib subdirectory:

    o mibble-parser-2.9.3.jar

    o mibble-mibs-2.9.3.jar

    o snmp6_0.jar (only required by MibbleBrowser)
